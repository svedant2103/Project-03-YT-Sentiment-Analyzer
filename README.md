# Project-03-YT-Sentiment-Analyzer
This project implements a production-ready YouTube comment sentiment analysis system using an end-to-end MLOps architecture. A Chrome extension extracts video comments and sends them to a deployed ML model that classifies each comment as positive or negative, enabling scalable and automated sentiment analysis.
